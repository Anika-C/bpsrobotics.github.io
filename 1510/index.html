        <h1>Who are the Wildcats?</h1>
          <p>Beaverton Public School Robotics is part of FIRST, and Team 1510 is an FRC Team. Although housed at Westview High School in Beaverton, students from all over Beaverton are encouraged to join Team 1510. In 2011 11 high schools from around the Beaverton School District were represented in Team 1510/2898. In early October 1510's club season starts. During club season, meetings occur on Thursdays from 3 PM to 6 PM. Club Season allows students to learn basic robot building skills in a low pressure environment before the stress of Build Season. The robotics class at Westview High School is another outlet for 1510 to recruit. Team members perform demonstrations of the past season's robot for each class. Team 1510 helps fund this class and suggests class material. This helps foster a large pool of skilled team members.</p>
        <h1>What is FIRST Robotics?</h1>
        <p>FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an organization which provides three levels of robotics competition for students aged 7-18. Along with teaching practical skills in STEM and business related areas, FIRST promotes the affective needs of students coining phrases such as "Gracious Professionalism" and "Co-opertition." The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is the highest level of robotics competition that FIRST offers. Students have 6 weeks to design and build a fully functioning robot, weighing approximately 120 pounds.</p>
