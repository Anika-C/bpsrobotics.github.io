	<h2>Flying Hedgehog Robot Family</h2>

	
	<h4>Game: Ultimate Ascent | year: 2013</h4>
	<p>
		In the 2013 game, Ultimate Ascent, two Alliances of three teams compete by shooting standard Frisbee discs into goals at the far end of the field to score. 
		At the end of the match, they climb "jungle-gym"-like pyramids to earn bonus points.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Game: Rebound Rumble | year: 2012</h4>
	<p>
		In the 2012 game, Rebound Rumble, two Alliances of three teams compete by trying to score as many basketballs in the hoops as possible during the two- minute and 15-second match. 
		Balls scored in higher hoops score Alliances more points. 
		Alliances are awarded bonus points if they are balanced on bridges at the end of the match. 
		In matches where opponent Alliances work together to balance on the white "Coopertition" bridge, all participating teams earn additional valuable seeding points.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Game: BREAKAWAY | year: 2010</h4>
	<p>
		In the 2010 game, BREAKAWAY, two alliances of three teams compete on a 27-by-54-foot field with bumps, attempting to earn points by collecting soccer balls in goals. 
		Additional bonus points are earned for each robot suspended in air and not touching the field at the end of the match.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Game: LUNACY | Year: 2009</h4>
	<p>
		In the 2009 game, LUNACY, robots are designed to pick up 9" game balls and score them in trailers hitched to their opponents' robots for points during a 2 minute and 15 second match. 
		Additional points are awarded for scoring a special game ball, the Super Cell, in the opponents' trailers during the last 20 seconds of the match. 
		"LUNACY" is played on a low-friction floor, which means teams must contend with the laws of physics.
